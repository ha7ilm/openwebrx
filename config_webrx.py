# ==== Color themes ====

# A guide is available to help you set these values: https://github.com/simonyiszk/openwebrx/wiki/Calibrating-waterfall-display-levels

### default theme by teejez:
waterfall_colors = [0x000000FF, 0x0000FFFF, 0x00FFFFFF, 0x00FF00FF, 0xFFFF00FF, 0xFF0000FF, 0xFF00FFFF, 0xFFFFFFFF]
waterfall_min_level = -88  # in dB
waterfall_max_level = -20
waterfall_auto_level_margin = (5, 40)
### old theme by HA7ILM:
# waterfall_colors = "[0x000000ff,0x2e6893ff, 0x69a5d0ff, 0x214b69ff, 0x9dc4e0ff,  0xfff775ff, 0xff8a8aff, 0xb20000ff]"
# waterfall_min_level = -115 #in dB
# waterfall_max_level = 0
# waterfall_auto_level_margin = (20, 30)
##For the old colors, you might also want to set [fft_voverlap_factor] to 0.

# Note: When the auto waterfall level button is clicked, the following happens:
#   [waterfall_min_level] = [current_min_power_level] - [waterfall_auto_level_margin[0]]
#   [waterfall_max_level] = [current_max_power_level] + [waterfall_auto_level_margin[1]]
