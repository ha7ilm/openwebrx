openwebrx (0.19.0) buster focal; urgency=low
  * Fix direwolf connection setup by implementing a retry loop
  * Pass direct sampling mode changes for rtl_sdr_soapy to owrx_connector
  * OSM maps instead of Google when google_maps_api_key is not set (thanks
    @jquagga)
  * Improved logic to pass parameters to soapy devices.
    - `rtl_sdr_soapy`: added support for `bias_tee`
    - `sdrplay`: added support for `bias_tee`, `rf_notch` and `dab_notch`
    - `airspy`: added support for `bitpack`
  * Added support for Perseus-SDR devices, (thanks @amontefusco)
  * Property System has been rewritten so that defaults on sdr behave as
    expected
  * Waterfall range auto-adjustment now only takes the center 80% of the
    spectrum into account, which should work better with SDRs that oversample
    or have rather flat filter curves towards the spectrum edges
  * Bugfix for negative network usage
  * FiFi SDR: prevent arecord from shutting down after 2GB of data has been
    sent
  * Added support for bias tee control on rtl_sdr devices
  * All connector driven SDRs now support `"rf_gain": "auto"` to enable AGC
  * `rtl_sdr` type now also supports the `direct_sampling` option
  * Added decoding implementation for for digimode "JS8Call" (requires an
    installation of js8call and the js8py library)
  * Reorganization of the frontend demodulator code
  * Improve receiver load time by concatenating javascript assets
  * HackRF support is now based on SoapyHackRF
  * Removed sdr.hu server listing support since the site has been shut down
  * Added support for Radioberry 2 Rasbperry Pi SDR Cape

openwebrx (0.18.0) buster; urgency=low

  * Compression, resampling and filtering in the frontend have been rewritten
    in javascript, sdr.js has been removed
  * Decoding of Pocsag modulation is now possible
  * Removed the 3D waterfall since it had no real application and required ~1MB
    of javascript code to be downloaded
  * Improved the frontend handling of the "too many users" scenario
  * PSK63 digimode is now available (same decoding pipeline as PSK31, but with
    adopted parameters)
  * The frequency can now be manipulated with the mousewheel, which should
    allow the user to tune more precise. The tuning step size is determined by
    the digit the mouse cursor is hovering over.
  * Clicking on the frequency now opens an input for direct frequency selection
  * URL hashes have been fixed and improved: They are now updated
    automatically, so a shared URL will include frequency and demodulator,
    which allows for improved sharing and linking.
  * New daylight scheduler for background decoding, allows profiles to be
    selected by local sunrise / sunset times
  * The owrx_connector is now the default way of communicating with sdr
    devices. The old sdr types have been replaced, all `_connector` suffixes on
    the type must be removed!
  * The sources have been refactored, making it a lot easier to add support for
    other devices
  * SDR device failure handling has been improved, including user feedback
  * New devices supported:
  * wsjt-x updated to 2.1.2
  * The rtl_tcp compatibility mode of the owrx_connector is now configurable
    using the `rtltcp_compat` flag
  * explicit device filter for soapy devices for multi-device setups
  * compatibility fixes for safari browsers (ios and mac)
  * Offset tuning using the `lfo_offset` has been reworked in a way that
    `center_freq` has to be set to the frequency you actually want to listen
    to. If you're using an `lfo_offset` already, you will probably need to
    change its sign.
  * `initial_squelch_level` can now be set on each profile.
  * Part of the frontend code has been reworked
    - Audio buffer minimums have been completely stripped. As a result, you
      should get better latency. Unfortunately, this also means there will be
      some skipping when audio starts.
    - Now also supports AudioWorklets (for those browser that have it).
    - Mousewheel controls for the receiver sliders
  * Error handling for failed SDR devices
  * One of the most-requested features is finally coming to OpenWebRX:
    Bookmarks (sometimes also referred to as labels).
    There's two kinds of bookmarks available:
    - Serverside bookmarks that are set up by the receiver administrator.
      Check the file `bookmarks.json` for examples!
    - Clientside bookmarks which every user can store for themselves. They are
      stored in the browser's localStorage.
  * Automatic reporting of spots to [pskreporter](https://pskreporter.info/) is
    now possible. Please have a look at the configuration on how to set it up.
  * Websocket communication has been overhauled in large parts. It should now
    be more reliable, and failing connections should now have no impact on
    other users.
  * Profile scheduling allows to set up band-hopping if you are running
    background services.
  * APRS now has the ability to show symbols on the map, if a corresponding
    symbol set has been installed. Check the config!
  * Debug logging has been disabled in a handful of modules, expect vastly
    reduced output on the shell.
  * New set of APRS-related features
    - Decode Packet transmissions using direwolf (1k2 only for now)
    - APRS packets are mostly decoded and shown both in a new panel and on the
      map
    - APRS is also available as a background service
    - direwolfs I-gate functionality can be enabled, which allows your receiver
      to work as a receive-only I-gate for the APRS network in the background
  * Demodulation for background services has been optimized to use less total
    bandwidth, saving CPU
  * More metrics have been added; they can be used together with collectd and
    its curl_json plugin for now, with some limitations.
  * New bandplan feature, the first thing visible is the "dial" indicator that
    brings you right to the dial frequency for digital modes
  * fixed some bugs in the websocket communication which broke the map
  * WSJT-X integration (FT8, FT4, WSPR, JT65, JT9 using wsjt-x demodulators)
  * New Map Feature that shows both decoded grid squares from FT8 and Locations
    decoded from YSF digital voice
  * New Feature report that will show what functionality is available
  * major rework on the openwebrx core
  * Support of multiple SDR devices simultaneously
  * Support for multiple profiles per SDR that allow the user to listen to
    different frequencies
  * Support for digital voice decoding
  * Feature detection that will disable functionality when dependencies are not
    available (if you're missing the digital
    buttons, this is probably why)
  * Support added for the following SDR sources:
    - LimeSDR (`"type": "lime_sdr"`)
    - PlutoSDR (`"type": "pluto_sdr"`)
    - RTL_SDR via Soapy (`"type": "rtl_sdr_soapy"`) on special request to allow
      use of the direct sampling mode
    - SoapyRemote (`"type": "soapy_remote"`)
    - FiFiSDR (`"type": "fifi_sdr"`)
    - airspyhf devices (Airspy HF+ / Discovery) (`"type": "airspyhf"`)
